## Project 1

## Project 2

The goal of the project is to draw 2D curves and regions using parametric and implicit representations.

| Representation | Description | Example |
| :---           | ---         | ---:    |
| Parametric | express the coordinates of each point of the curve according to a parameter | $ f(t) = (r*cos(t), r*sint(t)) $
| Implicit   | the points of the curve are the roots of an equation | $ x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0 $

In order to draw using the parametric representation, it is necessary to determine the step for the parameter t. There are several ways to it. One is to use constant steps. Another one is to use adaptive steps, where $ \Delta t $
